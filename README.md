# Codeless Data Mining

## Compare Similarity for 14 translater in Surah (Al-Fatihah)
 
## Overview
This is a text mining project to determine that Surah(Al-Fatihah) is also be Al-Fatihah even translate different 14 translater.But as a computer,it does not know what is Surah(Al-Fatihah). So, this project is about to teach computer to understand about Al-Fatihah with text mining with some mathematical metrix through codeless mining tool.

# Conclusion
   In this project, i use tfi-df to create weight frequecy of words and use cosine method to measure
   the distance between 14 documents of surah Al-fatihah.And i got the highest similarity score- 0.85
   and the lowest one is - 0.14
